## Introduction {#intro}

Deep learning (DL), a subfield of machine learning (ML) implementing artificial neural networks with many layers, is increasingly used for the analysis of biological data [@doi:10.1098/rsif.2017.0387].
The recent scientific literature has many examples of biological insights revealed through the evaluation of DL methods, ranging from predicting protein-drug binding kinetics [@doi:10.1038/s41467-017-02388-1] to identifying the lab-of-origin of synthetic DNA [@doi:10.1038/s41467-018-05378-z].
However, a lack of concise recommendations for biological applications of DL hamper newcomers wishing to apply state-of-the-art DL in their research.
As DL is an active and specialized research area, detailed resources are rapidly rendered obsolete and few resources articulate general DL best practices to the scientific community broadly and the biological community specifically.
To address this issue, we solicited input from a community of researchers with varied biological and deep learning interests, who wrote this manuscript collaboratively using the GitHub version control platform [@url:https://github.com/Benjamin-Lee/deep-rules] and Manubot [@url:https://greenelab.github.io/meta-review/].
In the course of our discussions, several themes became clear: the importance of understanding and applying ML fundamentals [@doi:10.1186/s13040-017-0155-3] as a baseline for using DL, the necessity for extensive model comparisons with careful evaluation, and the need for critical thought in interpreting results generated with DL, among others.
Ultimately, the tips we collate range from high-level guidance to implementing best practices, and we hope that they will provide actionable, DL-specific advice for both new and experienced DL practitioners alike who would like to employ DL in biological research.
By increasing the accessibility of DL techniques to biology, we aim to improve the overall quality and reporting of DL in the literature, enabling more researchers to apply these powerful methods to generate biological insights.
